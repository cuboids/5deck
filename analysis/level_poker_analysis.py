"""

Here we try to answer questions like:

- What is the distribution of deck levels?
- What is the distribution of board levels?
- What is the distribution of NLH hand levels?
- How often do we make what on showdown?

And we will perform simulations to determine:

- At a constant deck level, what percentile is each
NLH starting hand if we rank them in terms of all-in
equity vs. one opponent with any two cards?
